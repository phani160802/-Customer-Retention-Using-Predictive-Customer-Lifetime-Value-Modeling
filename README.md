# Customer-Retention-Using-Predictive-Customer-Lifetime-Value-Modeling

In today's competitive market, retaining customers is crucial for maximizing profits. Our project aimed to develop a strategic retention plan using predictive Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) modeling. We collected and preprocessed telecom customer data, merging datasets to enhance insights. By calculating CLTV, we identified high-value customers at risk of churning and used K-means clustering to segment them into high, medium, and low-value groups. Key features like contract type and premium services informed our segmentation.

To address data complexity, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential information. We then built predictive models using Decision Trees and Random Forests, fine-tuning them for optimal results. Our analysis of 1,409 customers revealed that 336 were likely to churn, including 135 high-value customers. This insight allows companies to focus retention efforts on high-value individuals, reducing marketing costs and enhancing retention strategies. By refining product offerings and improving customer service, companies can maintain a competitive edge and ensure long-term success.
